# SolutionDecisionnelle
Overview
This project, developed during my internship at the Digital Research Center of Sfax, involved the implementation of a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Decision Support Solution. The solution leveraged Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).

Description
The CRM Decision Support Solution aimed to enhance customer relationship management by providing valuable insights and data-driven decision support. Here's a brief overview of the technologies and tools used:

SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS): SSIS was utilized for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. It extracted data from various sources, transformed it into a usable format, and loaded it into the SQL Server database.

SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS): SSAS was employed for multidimensional data analysis and modeling, allowing for advanced data analytics and reporting.

Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project included:

Efficiently centralizing customer data.
Extracting valuable insights from customer data using SSIS.
Creating informative reports and dashboards for decision-makers with SSAS.
Improving customer relationship management through data-driven decisions.

Usage
To use this solution, follow these steps:

SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS): Implement SSIS packages to extract data from various sources, transform it as needed, and load it into the SQL Server database.

SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS): Design SSAS cubes and models to perform multidimensional data analysis and create reports and dashboards.
